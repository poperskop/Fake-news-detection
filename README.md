# Fake-news-detection
The Fake News detection dataset deals with the problem indirectly by using tabular summary statistics about each news article to attempt to predict whether the article is real or fake. This dataset is in a tabular format and contains features such as word count, sentence length, unique words, average word length, and a label indicating whether the article is fake or real.
